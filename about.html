            <h3>Kitty&apos;s Story</h3>
            <p>
                Kitty was adopted from a small shelter in Kentucky. She is a Shih Tzu Bichon mix with the personality of a star.

                She lived to be sixteen years old and made every year count. When she was out in public, people stopped in their tracks to look at her. Cars would literally slow down. Strangers asked for photos. It was not just her appearance, it was the way she carried herself. She genuinely loved the attention, soaking it up like she always knew she was special.

                Kitty went everywhere with me. She was always so perfect out and about. She could make people smile without trying and she handled every situation like a seasoned professional. I had many people say they were having a bad day until they met us.

                Within the grooming world, Kitty became a recognized name. Her creative grooming looks were featured, admired, and even included in a creative grooming book.

                She was perfect in that once-in-a-lifetime way. Everyone who met her remembered her.
